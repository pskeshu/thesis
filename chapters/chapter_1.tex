\section{DNA damage responses in cells}
Living organisms are continuously subjected to external and internal conditions that cause damage to their genetic material. It is estimated that a single mammalian cell is susceptible to upto 100,000 damaging events in a day \cite{ciccia2010dna}. When left unrepaired, such damages can result in mutations that can give rise to the downstream development of different cancers, and neurodegenerative diseases \cite{friedberg2005dna}. To overcome this problem of damage and error propagation in genetic information, cells have evolved diverse error detection and correction mechanisms, collectively known as DNA damage responses (DDR) \cite{hoeijmakers2009dna}. DDR often utilizes post-translational modifications (PTM), such as ubiqutination, phosphorylation, methylation etc. to propagate damage signals to downstream transducer proteins, like ATM or ATR. These transducers further effect higher-level decisions, such as checkpoint arrest to give the cell more time to repair, or if the damage is too extensive, proceed to apoptosis \cite{derks2014dna}.

\subsection{Importance of DNA}
\paragraph*{} All known life on Earth stores their hereditary information in double-stranded linear chain molecule known as deoxyribose nucleic acid, which is a continuous, unbranched, paired polymer chain made with nucleotide monomers. A nucleotide consists of a deoxyribose sugar with a phosphate group, and a base. Bases are one out of the four found in nature, which are Adenine (A), Guanine (G), Thymine (T) or Cytosine (C). Nucleotide with bases are strung together in a long linear chain that encodes a single strand of the genetic information. There are two strands, opposite to one another, each strand acts as a template to synthesize the opposite strand. The bases in opposite strands are always complementarity in nature, with A pairing opposite T, and G pairing opposite C. This allows for redundancy in the encoding level on the storage medium.

\paragraph*{} Much of the direct information output of the genetic material is thought to be in the synthesis of catalytic machines of the form of proteins or sometimes RNA. The sequence information in the DNA leads to a specific protein production, which plays a role in the overall working of the cell. The unit of information in this level is thought to be a gene, from which the blueprint of a protein is derived.

\paragraph*{} Information corruption at the genetic level, at the source of information content within the cell, will have a cascading corruption propogating through the information processing pipelines. As faulty gene information can result in faithful translation of protein structures, phenotypic outcomes can be unexpected.

\subsection{Sources of damage}
\paragraph*{} Broadly, the sources of information corruption can be classified as endogenous (or factors internal the cell), and exogenous (factors outside it). 

\paragraph*{} Some example of exogenous factors are ionizing radiations, which can break the strands of the DNA, sunlight, carcinogens from cigaratte smoke. 

\paragraph*{} Endogenously, there are many chemical reaction biproducts in the regular functioning of the cells which produces reactive oxygen species, which when in proximity of the DNA can damage the structure in different places of the bases.

\paragraph*{} Since there are many types of damage, the systems that exist to detect and repair them are diverse and elaborate. 

\subsection{DNA repair}
\paragraph*{} DNA repair is an event based system that responds to an event of chemical damage to the DNA. The event triggers the recruitment of downstream factors to the site of damage, to neccessiate repair. The downstream factors establish the site for repair, and prepare it for the recruitment for the appropriate repair machinary.

\subsection{Consequences of unrepaired DNA}

\subsection{Chromatin in DDR}
\paragraph*{} In eukaryotes, DNA is packaged as chromatin with the help of nucleosomes. In-vitro experiments have shown that the presence of nucleosomes hampers repair processes such as base excision repair (BER) and nucleotide excision repair (NER) \cite{hara2000dna, odell2011nucleosome}. This further increases the complexity of our understanding of DDR, as the repair processes have to seamlessly operate within the context of chromatin, which is a refractory environment for repair. However, chromatin modifying factors, such as SWI/SNF, histone acetyletransferases (HATs) have been shown to be recruited to sites of damage \cite{park2006mammalian, polo2010regulation}. Chromatin integrity factor, KAP-1, has been found to be a substrate of ATM, which shows chromatin modulation can be a downstream transducer effect of DDR \cite{ziv2006chromatin}. These results indicate that there exists an interplay between chromatin and DDR, which have traditionally been seen as distinct fields of study.

\paragraph*{} It has been shown that damage repair characteristics vary across the nucleus depending on the density of chromatin packaging. Markers of damage are seen to persist for longer in sites of densely packed DNA (heterochromatin regions) as compared to sites of loosely packed DNA (euchromatin regions) \cite{goodarzi2008atm}.

\paragraph*{} Since DDR processes and their complex boundaries with other known and unknown biological systems are not well-understood, it presents an opportunity to develop tools and techniques from across the fields of microscopy, robotics and image processing to study such biological processes in scale. While there have been studies of DDR in living cells using tools of live cell microscopy, these have used indirect readouts of chromatin compaction states and also have been limited in terms of throughput. Progress towards uncovering DDR would immensely help in addressing fundamental problems related to biological circuitry, such as stochasticity in responses, and further our knowledge of disease biology.

\subsection{Methods to study DDR in chromatin}
\paragraph*{} To this end in this thesis, I first describe the development of fluorescence anisotropy imaging tools to investigate chromatin compaction states upon laser-induced double strand breaks. Further to improve the throughput of such microscopic investigations we develop methods that improve statistics in both fixed and live cell investigations of DDR.



DNA in the eukaryotic cell nucleus is packaged into chromatin with histones and other protein components. This genetic material is susceptible to damage from different sources. It is estimated that in a day, a single mammalian cell can face as many as 100,000 lesions to its DNA (Ciccia and Elledge, 2010). If left unrepaired, such damage can result in cell cycle arrest, cell death, or senescence, or, at the level of the organism, cause mutations that result in diseases such as cancers or neurodegenerative diseases (Friedberg et al., 2006; Madabhushi et al., 2014). To deal with this constant assault on genetic material, cells have evolved a cohort of mechanisms that sense and repair DNA damage (Hoeijmakers, 2009).

Every DNA damage response (DDR) in eukaryotic cells takes place in the context of chromatin. Biochemical studies in in vitro systems with synthetically damaged DNA have helped uncover the critical role that chromatinization plays in DDR. In experiments with purified systems of repair, when a nucleosome was added to the naked DNA, measurements of repair kinetics by nucleotide excision repair (NER) and base excision repair (BER) indicated that the repair was much slower than that of naked DNA without a nucleosome (Hara et al., 2000; Odell et al., 2011). This led to the conclusion that the proteins that help package DNA inside the nucleus can have a hindering effect on damage repair. In cells, regions undergoing repair have been found to be more sensitive to micrococcal nuclease digestion than bulk DNA (Smerdon et al., 1978). This indicates that DNA can be more exposed during damage repair. Proteins that modify nucleosomes, such as SWI/SNF, and histone acetyltransferases (HATs), such as CHD4, have been found to be recruited to the site of damage, which indicates that the chromatin at the site of damage may be relaxed as a response to damage (Park et al., 2006; Polo et al. 2010). Further proteins that maintain chromatin integrity, such as KAP-1, have been found to be substrates for the DDR master kinase, ATM (Ziv et al., 2006).

A previous study has found that markers of repair persist in heterochromatin regions for longer time than in euchromatic regions (Goodarzi et al., 2008), indicating that the dynamics of repair is sensitive to the compaction state and activity of chromatin. With core histone H2B tagged with GFP and microirradiation of Hoechst-sensitized cells, it has been shown that chromatin is decompacted at the site of damage in response to clustered double-strand breaks (DSBs), followed by a phase of increased compaction (Kruhlak et al., 2006; Strickfaden et al., 2016). Compaction of chromatin is critical to DDR, and compaction in the absence of damage is sufficient to stimulate a damage response, independent of damage (Burgess et al., 2014). However, in experiments using microscopy, the spreading or shrinking of a chromatin region marked with a specific fluorescent histone has been used as a proxy for chromatin compaction, and as such does not report directly on physical state of the chromatin. In other studies, fluorescence anisotropy imaging (FAI) has been used to map the compaction of chromatin in living cells directly (Banerjee et al., 2006). Core histone H2B tagged with EGFP is excited with polarized light, which preferentially excites EGFP molecules whose excitation dipoles are oriented along the polarization axis of the excitation light. The extent of depolarization of the emission light gives a measure of the rotational diffusion of EGFP fusion proteins. The higher the rotational diffusion, the greater is the extent of depolarization of the emission signal, over and above what would be expected because of random orientations of the fluorophores. Fluorescence anisotropy is a measure of the extent of depolarization (Lakowicz, 2006; Ghosh et al., 2012). Since H2B-EGFP in the regions of euchromatin should have greater rotational mobility than regions of heterochromatin, anisotropy maps generated by FAI show evidence of differential compaction of chromatin and as such could be used as a direct physical measure of local chromatin packaging (Bhattacharya et al., 2009; Makhija et al., 2014). In this study, we sought to use FAI in the context of DDR to monitor chromatin compaction states directly. Chromatin decompaction is essential for repair, and yet local chromatin compaction may be used by cells to prevent further damage (Burgess et al., 2014). Using FAI, we studied the physical changes to the chromatin structure in response to laser microirradiation–induced clustered DSB, in regions of chromatin beyond just the site of damage. We show that anisotropy maps are preserved in fixation and regions of high and low anisotropy indeed correspond to physiologically relevant markers for heterochromatin and euchromatin, respectively. This also allows us to first follow compaction changes in response to localized DSBs in living cells, and then fix the cells and perform immunofluorescence for markers of DNA damage. Finally, we follow the differential dynamics of two endogenous damage-responsive proteins (PCNA and PARP1) with respect to chromatin compaction maps and show that their time scales of recruitment and subsequent dispersion are very different. In addition to being recruited at the site of damage, PCNA also forms nodes further away in regions of low anisotropy. These PCNA nodes in open chromatin incorporate deoxynucleotide analogs, indicating that individual DSBs from the laser-induced cluster may be extruded out from the site of damage for the purposes of repair. Together, these studies open up a new avenue of following DDR in live cells in the chromatin, while also taking advantage of different immunofluorescent markers for DNA damage and chromatin.
