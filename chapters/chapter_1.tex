\chapter{Introduction}
\section{DNA damage responses (DDR)}
\paragraph*{} It is estimated that in a day, a single mammalian cell can face as many as 100,000 lesions to its DNA \cite{ciccia2010dna}. Because of its chemical nature, it has a tendency to react with the chemical environment that surrounds it. This makes the information stored in this molecule to become inherently unstable over time, as gradually changes can accumulate in the molecule. Largely, chemical reactions can affect the genetic material in the level of the nitrogenous base, the nucleotide, and the phosphodiester bond. The base can be subjected to damages due to spontaneous processes such as deamination, or methylation. There can also be oxidative damage to the amino groups due the prescence of free radicals. If left unrepaired, such damage can result in cell cycle arrest, cell death, or senescence, or, at the level of the organism, cause mutations that result in diseases such as cancers or neurodegenerative diseases \cite{friedberg2005dna, madabhushi2014dna}.

\paragraph*{} For convinience, the sources of damage can be largely grouped as factors outside the cell, or exogenous sources, and factors inside the cell, arising from the overall cellular machinery, which are endogenous to the cells. Exogenous sources may include ionizing radiations from space, high energy photons from Sun, or carcinogenic industrial chemicals that are present in the environment due to human activity. Endogenously, chemical biproducts in biogenesis results in the formation of free radicals, which when in proximity to another molecule can freely exchange electrons, changing the electronic configurations of molecules, creating unstability.

\paragraph*{} DNA that is damaged has to be repaired. Since there are several types of damage that are chemically distinct, to deal with this constant assault on genetic material, cells have evolved a cohort of mechanisms that sense and repair different types of DNA damage \cite{hoeijmakers2009dna}. Also, unlike other DNA processes, such as replication or transcription, damages to DNA are stochastic, which requires repair systems to have a continuous watch on the molecular health of the DNA. The repair mechanism is triggered by a damaging event which further triggers downstream recruitment of factors of repair to the site of damage. DDR often utilizes post-translational modifications (PTM), such as ubiqutination, phosphorylation, methylation etc. to propagate damage signals to downstream transducer proteins, like ATM or ATR. These transducers further effect higher-level decisions, such as checkpoint arrest to give the cell more time to repair, or if the damage is too extensive, proceed to apoptosis \cite{derks2014dna}.

\section{Repair in the context of chromatin}
\paragraph*{} DNA in the eukaryotic cell nucleus is packaged into chromatin with histones and other protein components. Every DNA damage response (DDR) in eukaryotic cells takes place in the context of chromatin. Biochemical studies in in vitro systems with synthetically damaged DNA have helped uncover the critical role that chromatinization plays in DDR. In experiments with purified systems of repair, when a nucleosome was added to the naked DNA, measurements of repair kinetics by nucleotide excision repair (NER) and base excision repair (BER) indicated that the repair was much slower than that of naked DNA without a nucleosome \cite{hara2000dna,odell2011nucleosome}. This led to the conclusion that the proteins that help package DNA inside the nucleus can have a hindering effect on damage repair. 

\paragraph*{} In cells, regions undergoing repair have been found to be more sensitive to micrococcal nuclease digestion than bulk DNA \cite{smerdon1978distribution}. This indicates that DNA can be more exposed during damage repair. Proteins that modify nucleosomes, such as SWI/SNF, and histone acetyltransferases (HATs), such as CHD4, have been found to be recruited to the site of damage, which indicates that the chromatin at the site of damage may be relaxed as a response to damage \cite{park2006mammalian, polo2010regulation}. Further proteins that maintain chromatin integrity, such as KAP-1, have been found to be substrates for the DDR master kinase, ATM \cite{ziv2006chromatin}.

\paragraph*{} A previous study has found that markers of repair persist in heterochromatin regions for longer time than in euchromatic regions \cite{goodarzi2008atm}, indicating that the dynamics of repair is sensitive to the compaction state and activity of chromatin. With core histone H2B tagged with GFP and microirradiation of Hoechst-sensitized cells, it has been shown that chromatin is decompacted at the site of damage in response to clustered double-strand breaks (DSBs), followed by a phase of increased compaction \cite{kruhlak2006changes,strickfaden2016poly}. Compaction of chromatin is critical to DDR, and compaction in the absence of damage is sufficient to stimulate a damage response, independent of damage \cite{BURGESS20141703}.

\section{Opportunities and outcome}
\paragraph*{} Since DDR processes and their complex boundaries with other known and unknown biological systems are not well-understood, it presents an opportunity to develop tools and techniques from across the fields of microscopy and image analysis to study such biological processes in scale. While there have been studies of DDR in living cells using tools of live cell microscopy, these have used fluorescently marked histones whose expansion or contraction is used as a proxy for chromatin dynamics \cite{BURGESS20141703,kruhlak2006changes}. However, these measurements does not report directly on physical state of the chromatin. Progress towards uncovering DDR mechanisms would immensely help in addressing fundamental problems related to biological circuitry, such as stochasticity in responses, and further our knowledge of disease biology.

\paragraph*{} In other studies, fluorescence anisotropy imaging (FAI) has been used to map the compaction of chromatin in living cells directly \cite{banerjee2006chromatin}. Core histone H2B tagged with EGFP is excited with polarized light, which preferentially excites EGFP molecules whose excitation dipoles are oriented along the polarization axis of the excitation light. The extent of depolarization of the emission light gives a measure of the rotational diffusion of EGFP fusion proteins. The higher the rotational diffusion, the greater is the extent of depolarization of the emission signal, over and above what would be expected because of random orientations of the fluorophores. Fluorescence anisotropy is a measure of the extent of depolarization \cite{lakowicz2013principles,ghosh2012dynamic}. Since H2B-EGFP in the regions of euchromatin should have greater rotational mobility than regions of heterochromatin, anisotropy maps generated by FAI show evidence of differential compaction of chromatin and as such could be used as a direct physical measure of local chromatin packaging \cite{bhattacharya2009spatio}. In this study, we sought to use FAI in the context of DDR to monitor chromatin compaction states directly. Chromatin decompaction is essential for repair, and yet local chromatin compaction may be used by cells to prevent further damage \cite{BURGESS20141703}. 

\paragraph*{} Using FAI, we studied the physical changes to the chromatin structure in response to laser microirradiationâ€“induced clustered DSB, in regions of chromatin beyond just the site of damage. We show that anisotropy maps are preserved in fixation and regions of high and low anisotropy indeed correspond to physiologically relevant markers for heterochromatin and euchromatin, respectively. This also allows us to first follow compaction changes in response to localized DSBs in living cells, and then fix the cells and perform immunofluorescence for markers of DNA damage. Finally, we follow the differential dynamics of two endogenous damage-responsive proteins (PCNA and PARP1) with respect to chromatin compaction maps and show that their time scales of recruitment and subsequent dispersion are very different. In addition to being recruited at the site of damage, PCNA also forms nodes further away in regions of low anisotropy. These PCNA nodes in open chromatin incorporate deoxynucleotide analogs, indicating that individual DSBs from the laser-induced cluster may be extruded out from the site of damage for the purposes of repair. Together, these studies open up a new avenue of following DDR in live cells in the chromatin, while also taking advantage of different immunofluorescent markers for DNA damage and chromatin.
